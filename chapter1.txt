The circle constant
The Tau Manifesto is dedicated to one of the most important numbers in mathematics, perhaps the 
most important: the circle constant relating the circumference of a circle to its linear dimension. 
For millennia, the circle has been considered the most perfect of shapes, and the circle constant captures 
the geometry of the circle in a single number. Of course, the traditional choice for the circle constant is π—but,
 as mathematician Bob Palais notes in his delightful article “π Is Wrong!”,1 π is wrong. It’s time to set things right.

(Note: Mathematically sophisticated readers, including those already familiar with The Tau Manifesto, can 
skip directly to Section 5, which is part of a revision released on Tau Day, 2012. This new section builds an 
irrefutable case against π.)
